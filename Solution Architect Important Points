Solution Architects focus on:
how technologies can be used to solve this business problem;
what framework, platform, or technical stack can be used to create a solution;
how the application will look, what modules will be, and how they will interact with each other;
how the digital solution will scale in the future and how it will be supported;
figuring out the risk in third party frameworks/platforms;
find a solution to a business problem.
